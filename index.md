## Overview

I'm currently a Data Analyst at HM Revenue & Customs. I have a strong Mathematical background, with experience in Machine Learning, Analysis and Problem Solving. I'm passionate about learning new skills, driven by curiosity and self-improvement and am seeking the opportunity to collaborate within a team of like-minded individuals.

## Technical Skills

**Python**
&emsp;`4+ years` <br>
Thorough understanding of advanced functionality. I've used it for Machine Learning, Web Scraping, tapping into APIs and creating interfaces, amongst other applications.
<br><br>

**Machine Learning**
&emsp;`2+ years` <br>
Built common models (Linear/Logistic Regression, Neural Network, SVM, KMeans clustering) in MatLab as part of Andrew Ng's Coursera course. Have since implemented using Python's Scikit-Learn, focusing on Random Forest Regression/Classifiers for personal projects. Also built KMeans clustering in Excel to demonstrate use case to fellow analysts.
<br><br>

**Computer Science**
<br> 
Completed course _from Nand to Tetris_. Constructed 16-bit CPU and RAM from NAND gates, created Assembly Language, Virtual Machine and High-Level Language, using Python. Have good knowledge of trade-offs between memory and speed and have gained a continued understanding of efficiencies.
<br><br>

**SAS EG & SQL**
&emsp;`1 year` <br>
Utilise daily in current job role. Solid knowledge of data cleaning, joining and analysis, of large amounts of data across multiple datasets.
<br><br>

**Excel/VBA** <br>
Continued knowledge of Excel and VBA, throughout education and career. I've built a Project Management tool, which I used for about 5 years across jobs and I'm currently part of a team to maintain and add features to data collection tools.
<br><br>

**HTML/CSS**
&emsp;`2+ years` <br>
Have a good grounding, utilising bootstrapping to create webpages ([e.g. SAS functions reference](https://s.codepen.io/roflrick27/debug/yvyvgo/jVApogqxXxPr)). Also, comfortable with web scraping using nested tags, classes and id's as references.

### Tools

Jupyter Notebook, Git, Github, Regular Expressions, Anaconda.

### Libraries

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, RegEx, BeautifulSoup.


## Personal Projects

**RightMove API** <br>
Web scraping *Python* app to find properties with a variety of requirements. Extracts property data, passing search criteria to a class object and seamlessly exports to *Pandas* Dataframe. Working on description analysis, and blending with area demographics and Google's Map API.
<br><br>
**FTSE Stock Picker** <br> 
Using *Scikit-Learn's* Random Forest Classifier to pick stocks, which will increase by a specified threshold. Includes hyperparameter optimisation, several financial features created in *NumPy* and Backtesting. Working on improving threshold analysis and damage control for false positives.

## Independent Learning

*  [Computer Science - From Nand to Tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/)
* Certificate in Financial Mathematics (Institute and Faculty of Actuaries)
* [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* HTML/CSS (FreeCodeCamp)
* [Game Theory (Cousera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1)
* A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behaviour (Coursera)
* Acting/Presentation skills (SwindonAct).


### Interests
* Coding challenges (CodeEval, Advent of Code)
* Podcasts (Partially Derivative, Data Skeptic, Talk Python)
* Regularly read weekly tutorials/blog posts, on statistics, data and Python
* Running Club and 5-a-side Football.
